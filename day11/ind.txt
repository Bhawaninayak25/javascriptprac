Perfect 👌 — here are hands-on JavaScript tasks that combine comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=) with arrays, map, filter, for...in, and if statements.
These are great for teaching or testing students’ understanding of both comparison logic and array iteration.

✅ JavaScript Tasks on Comparison Operators

🧩 Task 1 — Filter passing students
Concepts: filter(), >=, if
const marks = [45, 67, 89, 23, 50, 90];

// ✅ Task: Use filter() to get all marks greater than or equal to 50

👉 Expected Output: [67, 89, 50, 90]

🧩 Task 2 — Identify failed students
Concepts: filter(), <, if
const students = [
  { name: "Amit", marks: 35 },
  { name: "Priya", marks: 70 },
  { name: "Ravi", marks: 48 },
  { name: "Neha", marks: 80 }
];

// ✅ Task: Use filter() to find all students with marks less than 50

👉 Expected Output:
 [{ name: "Amit", marks: 35 }, { name: "Ravi", marks: 48 }]

🧩 Task 3 — Check equality of two arrays (length check only)
Concepts: ==, ===, if
const arr1 = [10, 20, 30];
const arr2 = [10, 20, 30];

// ✅ Task: Use if condition to check whether arr1 and arr2 are the same array

👉 Hint: Use == and === and note the difference in behavior.

🧩 Task 4 — Tag high scores
Concepts: map(), >, if
const scores = [50, 78, 95, 40, 88];

// ✅ Task: Use map() to create a new array where each score is replaced by:
// "High" if > 80, else "Low"

👉 Expected Output:
 ["Low", "Low", "High", "Low", "High"]

🧩 Task 5 — Compare employee ages
Concepts: for...in, >, <, if
const employees = {
  raj: 28,
  seema: 32,
  anil: 26,
  rita: 35
};

// ✅ Task: Using for...in loop, print:
// "Young employee" if age < 30
// "Senior employee" if age >= 30

👉 Expected Output:
raj is a Young employee
seema is a Senior employee
anil is a Young employee
rita is a Senior employee


🧩 Task 6 — Filter even numbers
Concepts: filter(), %, ==
const numbers = [10, 13, 25, 40, 55, 66];

// ✅ Task: Use filter() to get only even numbers using comparison operator (==)

👉 Expected Output: [10, 40, 66]

🧩 Task 7 — Find students with same marks
Concepts: for...in, ===, if
const studentsMarks = { amit: 50, raj: 70, priya: 50, rina: 60 };

// ✅ Task: Print names of students who have marks equal to 50

👉 Expected Output:
amit has 50 marks
priya has 50 marks


🧩 Task 8 — Categorize products by price
Concepts: map(), >, <, if
const prices = [99, 150, 200, 49, 120];

// ✅ Task: Use map() to return an array of:
// "Cheap" if price < 100
// "Moderate" if price between 100 and 150
// "Expensive" if price > 150

👉 Expected Output:
 ["Cheap", "Moderate", "Expensive", "Cheap", "Moderate"]

🧩 Task 9 — Filter adults
Concepts: filter(), >=, if
const ages = [12, 18, 25, 10, 30];

// ✅ Task: Use filter() to return only ages >= 18

👉 Expected Output: [18, 25, 30]

🧩 Task 10 — Check if two numbers are not equal
Concepts: !=, !==, if
const a = "20";
const b = 20;

// ✅ Task: Compare a and b using != and !== and log results

👉 Expected Output:
Using != : false
Using !== : true
